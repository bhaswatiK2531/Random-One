                        <p>In DBT, mindfulness is broken down into “What” and “How” skills. “What” is what we actually do when we are practicing mindfulness. The first skill is to Observe– we can observe internally or externally. This is just noticing what we may see, hear etc., or what we are feeling, thinking or noticing within ourselves. The second skill is to Describe what we see or what we experience without judgment. For example, if I’m looking at a picture I would just describe exactly what I see. I would not state whether or not I liked the picture. The third skill is to Participate. This means to fully throw ourselves into the experience. For example, when you’re dancing, you would allow yourself to fully dance while letting go of inhibition or judgment or feelings of self-consciousness. The “How” is how you practice mindfulness. The first skill is Nonjudgment. This is to let go of evaluations of “good/bad” etc. The second is One-mindfully. This means to do one thing at a time, letting go of multitasking. The third is Effectively. This means to let go of right versus wrong/ fair vs. unfair. It means to act as skillfully as the goal requires. It is to do whatever is needed in the moment.
